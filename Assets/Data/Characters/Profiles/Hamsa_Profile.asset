  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: hamsa_swan
  _displayName: Hamsa
  _title: The Divine Swan
  _species: Hamsa (Celestial Swan)
  _shortDescription: |
    A sacred swan who serves as the vehicle of the goddess of knowledge. 
    Hamsa has the legendary ability to separate milk from water - 
    symbolizing the wisdom to discern truth from illusion.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the celestial realm, Hamsa was the mount of Saraswati, goddess of 
    wisdom, knowledge, and the arts. For eons, he carried her across the 
    cosmos, absorbing divine wisdom with every journey.
    
    Hamsa's legendary power is separation - he can drink milk mixed with 
    water and separate the pure from the diluted. This extends beyond the 
    literal: Hamsa can see through lies, pierce illusions, and discern 
    truth in all things.
    
    When Saraswati sensed the Shadow Serpent's corruption spreading through 
    mortal lands, she sent her beloved Hamsa to aid the guardians. "They 
    fight with strength," she told him. "Give them wisdom to match."
    
    Hamsa finds the mortal world fascinating but chaotic. He speaks in 
    riddles and metaphors, often frustrating those who want simple answers. 
    But those who listen carefully find profound truth in his words.
    
    He's not a warrior by nature - Hamsa prefers to guide, illuminate, and 
    reveal. But when wisdom fails and battle is unavoidable, his wings 
    become blades of pure light, cutting through darkness with surgical 
    precision.
