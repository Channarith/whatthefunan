  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: kinnari_bird
  _displayName: Kinnari
  _title: The Golden Voice
  _species: Kinnara (Half-Bird, Half-Human)
  _shortDescription: |
    A graceful bird-maiden whose songs can heal wounds and inspire courage. 
    Separated from her beloved Kinnara during the Shadow's attack, she 
    searches for him while spreading hope through her music.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the Himaphan Forest, where the sky meets the clouds, live the Kinnara - 
    beings of pure beauty with human torsos and bird wings. Among them, Kinnari's 
    voice was said to be the most beautiful sound in all creation.
    
    She and her partner, a male Kinnara named Manohra's brother Rathasena, 
    lived in perfect harmony. Their duets could make flowers bloom and storms 
    calm. They were inseparable - until the Shadow Serpent came.
    
    The darkness scattered the Kinnara flock. In the chaos, Kinnari was 
    separated from Rathasena. She searched the skies for days, her songs 
    turning from joy to mourning, until she collapsed from exhaustion in 
    Funan territory.
    
    Champa found her and nursed her back to health. Now Kinnari travels with 
    the guardians, using her healing songs to aid their quest while secretly 
    hoping each new horizon will reunite her with her lost love.
    
    Despite her grief, Kinnari never stops singing. "Music," she says, "is 
    how we prove that beauty still exists in dark times."
