  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: vorvong_prince
  _displayName: Vorvong
  _title: The Wandering Prince
  _species: Human (Royal Lineage)
  _shortDescription: |
    An exiled prince who wanders the land seeking to right wrongs and 
    prove his worth. His twin brother Sorvong fights beside him, their 
    bond unbreakable despite the betrayal that cast them out.
  _fullBiography: |
    Prince Vorvong was born seven minutes before his twin Sorvong, making 
    him heir to a powerful kingdom. The brothers were inseparable - where 
    one went, the other followed. They trained together, studied together, 
    and swore they would rule together someday.
    
    Their stepmother had other plans.
    
    Through lies and manipulation, she convinced the King that the twins 
    were plotting against him. Heartbroken, the King exiled his own sons 
    rather than execute them. Vorvong and Sorvong left with nothing but 
    their swords and each other.
    
    Years of wandering hardened them into legendary warriors. They became 
    known as champions of the common people, fighting bandits and corrupt 
    officials. Stories spread of twin swordsmen who appeared like ghosts 
    and vanished like dreams.
    
    Vorvong carries the burden of being the elder. Every decision weighs 
    on him - he feels responsible for Sorvong, for their exile, for 
    everyone they meet. He masks his worry with stoic determination.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent's corruption reached their former kingdom, 
    the twins faced a choice: let the father who exiled them fall, or 
    return to save a home that rejected them. They chose to return.
