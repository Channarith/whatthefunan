  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: preahko_bull
  _displayName: Preah Ko
  _title: The Sacred Bull of Shiva
  _species: Divine Bull (Nandi)
  _shortDescription: |
    A sacred bull who has guarded the temples of Funan for a thousand years. 
    Stoic, patient, and impossibly strong, Preah Ko speaks little but acts 
    with absolute conviction when innocents are threatened.
  _fullBiography: |
    When the first temple was built in Funan, the gods sent a guardian to 
    protect it. That guardian was Preah Ko - a white bull of impossible 
    purity, blessed by Shiva himself to watch over sacred places.
    
    For centuries, Preah Ko stood silent vigil at temple gates. Pilgrims 
    would touch his stone form for blessings, never knowing that the 
    statue could move, think, and feel. He watched generations come and go, 
    learning patience that only eternity can teach.
    
    He was there when kings were crowned and when they fell. He was there 
    when temples were built and when they crumbled. Through it all, Preah Ko 
    remained - steadfast, silent, eternal.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent defiled the sacred temples, Preah Ko finally 
    moved. His stone form cracked as he stepped from his pedestal for the 
    first time in centuries, revealing living muscle beneath. The Shadow's 
    minions learned that some guardians never truly sleep.
    
    Now Preah Ko walks among the living once more. He struggles to understand 
    this new world - its noise, its haste, its strange customs. But his 
    purpose remains unchanged: protect the sacred, guard the innocent.
