  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: kangrei_bamboo
  _displayName: Neang Kangrei
  _title: Spirit of the Bamboo Grove
  _species: Forest Spirit (Nature Guardian)
  _shortDescription: |
    A gentle spirit who emerged from a magical bamboo grove. She speaks 
    to plants, commands the forest's creatures, and fights to protect 
    nature from those who would destroy it.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the heart of Cambodia's oldest bamboo forest, where sunlight filters 
    through green canopy and wind makes the stalks sing, a spirit was born 
    from the land's love for itself.
    
    Neang Kangrei doesn't remember a time before she existed - she simply 
    WAS, the same way the forest simply IS. She tends to every plant, knows 
    every creature by name, and feels physical pain when trees are cut down.
    
    For centuries, she avoided humans. She watched them from the shadows, 
    curious but cautious. Some respected the forest; others destroyed it. 
    She learned that humans were... complicated.
    
    When loggers came with machines, Kangrei revealed herself to stop them. 
    Not with violence - she made the forest itself protect them. Vines that 
    gently restrained. Trees that blocked paths. Animals that led them in 
    circles until they gave up.
    
    The Shadow Serpent's corruption was different. It KILLED the forest. 
    Trees withered, animals fled, the very soil turned to ash. For the 
    first time, Kangrei felt true rage.
    
    Now she fights alongside the guardians, learning that some battles 
    require more than gentle redirection. But she never kills if she can 
    help it - even enemies are part of nature, somewhere deep down.
