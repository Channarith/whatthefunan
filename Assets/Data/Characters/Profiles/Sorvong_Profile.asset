  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: sorvong_prince
  _displayName: Sorvong
  _title: The Phantom Prince
  _species: Human (Royal Lineage)
  _shortDescription: |
    The younger twin, born seven minutes after Vorvong. Where his brother 
    is the shield, Sorvong is the blade in the dark. He uses stealth and 
    cunning to complement his brother's direct approach.
  _fullBiography: |
    Being born second defined Sorvong's life. Even by seven minutes, he 
    would never be king. Some would resent this - Sorvong embraced it. 
    "You be the hero," he told Vorvong. "I'll be the shadow that makes 
    heroes possible."
    
    While Vorvong trained in honorable combat, Sorvong studied stealth, 
    infiltration, and the art of striking from darkness. Not because he 
    was dishonorable, but because he understood: sometimes justice requires 
    a blade that no one sees coming.
    
    When they were exiled, Sorvong didn't cry. He planned. His network of 
    informants across the kingdom began that very night. While Vorvong 
    protected villages openly, Sorvong worked in shadows - sabotaging 
    bandits before they could attack, spreading truth to counter their 
    stepmother's lies.
    
    Sorvong hides his pain behind humor and wit. He deflects with jokes 
    because acknowledging the hurt of exile might break him. Only Vorvong 
    sees past the mask to the wounded prince beneath.
    
    He would die for his brother. More importantly, he would kill for him. 
    That's what being the shadow means.
