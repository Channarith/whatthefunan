  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: mekhala_lightning
  _displayName: Moni Mekhala
  _title: Goddess of the Sea and Lightning
  _species: Deva (Goddess)
  _shortDescription: |
    A playful goddess who controls lightning through her magical crystal 
    ball. Her eternal game of keep-away with Ream Eyso creates the storms 
    that bring life-giving rain to Cambodia.
  _fullBiography: |
    Long ago, the hermit sage taught two students the ultimate magic. To 
    Moni Mekhala, he gave a crystal ball that could create lightning. To 
    Ream Eyso, he gave an axe that could summon thunder. When they used 
    their gifts together, rain would fall.
    
    But Ream Eyso grew jealous of Mekhala's crystal - its light was more 
    beautiful than his thunder. He demanded she give it to him. She refused. 
    And so began their eternal chase across the sky.
    
    To Mekhala, this is all a grand game. She dances through clouds, her 
    laughter echoing with each lightning flash. When Ream Eyso throws his 
    axe in frustration, she reflects it with her crystal - creating the 
    spectacular storms that Cambodians celebrate.
    
    The Shadow Serpent threatened to end their game permanently. It sought 
    to swallow both the crystal and the axe, ending all storms. For the 
    first time, Mekhala and Ream Eyso had to work together instead of 
    against each other.
    
    Now Mekhala brings her lightning to the battle against darkness, though 
    she still can't resist teasing her eternal rival. "All work and no play," 
    she says, "makes for very boring thunderstorms!"
