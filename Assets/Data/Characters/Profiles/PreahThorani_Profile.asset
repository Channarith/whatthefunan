  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: thorani_earth
  _displayName: Preah Thorani
  _title: Mother Earth, The Witness
  _species: Deva (Earth Goddess)
  _shortDescription: |
    The goddess of the earth who once saved the Buddha from demons by 
    wringing flood waters from her hair. She witnesses all good deeds 
    and remembers every act of kindness ever performed.
  _fullBiography: |
    When the Buddha sat beneath the Bodhi tree, the demon Mara sent his 
    armies to stop enlightenment. The Buddha had no defenders - or so 
    Mara thought. He called upon the earth itself to witness his countless 
    lifetimes of good deeds.
    
    And the earth answered.
    
    Preah Thorani rose from the ground, beautiful and terrible. She wrung 
    her long hair, and from it poured all the water from all the offerings 
    of all the Buddha's previous lives. The flood swept away Mara's demons 
    like leaves in a monsoon.
    
    That was her greatest act, but not her only one. Thorani IS the earth. 
    She feels every footstep, absorbs every tear, remembers every kindness. 
    She is the silent witness to all of history.
    
    The Shadow Serpent's corruption is an infection in her very body. It 
    HURTS. For the first time since Mara, Thorani has risen fully, taking 
    physical form to fight a threat to all who walk upon her.
    
    She is patient, ancient, and infinitely powerful - but she doesn't 
    enjoy fighting. Every enemy she defeats was once a child who played 
    upon her. She remembers them all.
