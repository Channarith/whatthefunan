  _characterId: reahu_eclipse
  _displayName: Reahu
  _title: The Eternal Eclipse
  _species: Asura (Demon) - Severed Head
  _shortDescription: |
    An ancient demon whose head was severed by the gods, yet lives on 
    eternally. Once consumed by rage and hunger for the sun, Reahu has 
    learned that darkness need not be evil.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the beginning, when gods and demons churned the cosmic ocean for the 
    nectar of immortality, Reahu disguised himself among the divine and 
    drank from the sacred cup. The Sun and Moon saw through his deception 
    and exposed him.
    
    The god Vishnu's divine discus severed Reahu's head from his body - but 
    the nectar had already touched his lips. His head became immortal, forever 
    separated from his body, forever hungry, forever in darkness.
    
    For eons, Reahu chased the Sun and Moon across the sky, swallowing them 
    in his rage only for them to pass through his severed neck. Each eclipse 
    was his futile attempt at revenge.
    
    But immortality changes perspective. After millions of years, Reahu's 
    rage cooled to acceptance, then curiosity. He began to wonder: what if 
    he used his power over darkness to protect rather than destroy?
    
    When the Shadow Serpent emerged, Reahu recognized a kindred darkness - 
    but one without conscience. For the first time, Reahu chose to fight 
    FOR the light, not against it. Even demons can change.
