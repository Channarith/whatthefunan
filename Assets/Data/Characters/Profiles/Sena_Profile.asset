  _characterId: sena_lion
  _displayName: Sena
  _title: The Unbreaking Shield
  _species: Temple Guardian Lion (Khmer Guardian)
  _shortDescription: |
    A noble lion guardian bound by duty and honor. He takes his role as 
    protector very, VERY seriously. Too seriously, some might say.
  _fullBiography: |
    For seven generations, Sena's family has guarded the great gates of 
    Funan. His father guarded the gates. His father's father guarded the 
    gates. Sena was born knowing one truth: he would guard those gates, 
    and nothing - NOTHING - would get through.
    
    He trained from birth. While other lion cubs played, Sena practiced 
    formations. While they napped, he did patrol exercises. By age five, 
    he could recite the entire Guardian Code from memory. He was perfect.
    
    Perfectly serious.
    
    "You need to relax," his mother would say. "Smile sometimes!" But Sena 
    couldn't relax. Lives depended on his vigilance. If he smiled, he might 
    miss something. If he laughed, he might—
    
    Then the Shadow Serpent came. And despite everything - every training, 
    every vigil, every sacrifice - the gates fell. Sena failed. The one 
    thing he was born to prevent happened anyway.
    
    Broken, he nearly gave up. But Champa found him. "You didn't fail," she 
    said. "The gates fell so we could find each other. Now we guard something 
    bigger together."
    
    Now Sena learns that duty isn't about never failing - it's about always 
    getting back up. And maybe, just maybe, he's learning to smile.
