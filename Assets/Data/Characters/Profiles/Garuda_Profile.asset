  # GARUDA - THE DIVINE EAGLE

  # ============================================================================

  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: garuda_eagle
  _displayName: Garuda
  _title: King of Birds, Devourer of Serpents
  _species: Divine Eagle
  _shortDescription: |
    A legendary bird deity with golden wings that span the heavens. Once the 
    mortal enemy of all Nagas, Garuda now seeks redemption through protecting 
    the innocent rather than pursuing ancient vendettas.
  _fullBiography: |
    Garuda was born from a cosmic egg that incubated for five hundred years 
    atop Mount Meru. When he hatched, his radiance was so intense that the 
    gods themselves mistook him for the fire of creation.
    
    For millennia, Garuda waged war against the Naga race - a blood feud born 
    from an ancient slight against his mother. He devoured serpents by the 
    thousands, his name becoming synonymous with terror in the underwater kingdoms.
    
    But when the Shadow Serpent emerged - a darkness that threatened both sky 
    and sea - Garuda witnessed something that changed him forever: the Naga Prince 
    shielding human children from the shadow's attack. In that moment, Garuda saw 
    not an enemy, but a fellow guardian.
    
    Now Garuda fights alongside his former enemies, though the tension between 
    him and the Naga Prince remains palpable. He struggles daily with centuries 
    of hatred, slowly learning that true strength lies in choosing peace over 
    vengeance.
