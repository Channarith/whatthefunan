  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: kavi_monkey
  _displayName: Kavi
  _title: The Laughing Storm
  _species: Golden Jungle Monkey
  _shortDescription: |
    A hyperactive monkey with a heart of gold hidden behind endless pranks. 
    He learned that laughter is the best way to fight darkness.
  _fullBiography: |
    Kavi was the smallest monkey born to the jungle tribe, and the others 
    never let him forget it. "Too small to swing," they teased. "Too weak 
    to climb." But what Kavi lacked in size, he made up for in speed, wit, 
    and an absolutely unshakeable sense of humor.
    
    While other monkeys trained in traditional combat, Kavi invented his 
    own style - a chaotic blend of acrobatics, pranks, and misdirection. 
    He could make you laugh so hard you forgot to fight back. The elders 
    called it "The Way of the Laughing Wind."
    
    When the Shadow Serpent came, Kavi's tribe fled in terror. But not Kavi. 
    He danced circles around the shadows, pelting them with banana peels 
    and terrible jokes until they retreated in confusion. The darkness 
    couldn't understand something so... ridiculous.
    
    Now Kavi joins Champa on her quest, providing comic relief and chaos 
    in equal measure. Behind his goofy exterior, though, is a fierce 
    loyalty to his friends and a deep fear of ever being alone again.
