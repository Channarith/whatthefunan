  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: kriting_chimera
  _displayName: Kriting
  _title: The Noble Chimera
  _species: Kirtimukha/Kriting (Lion-Elephant Hybrid)
  _shortDescription: |
    A magnificent creature with an elephant's head and a lion's body, 
    combining the wisdom of one with the courage of the other. Kriting 
    guards the boundary between the mortal and divine realms.
  _fullBiography: |
    The Kriting are rare - creatures born when destiny requires a bridge 
    between two worlds. This Kriting emerged from a sacred temple carving 
    that had been prayed to for centuries. So many wished for protection 
    that the stone itself came alive.
    
    With an elephant's patient wisdom and a lion's fierce courage, Kriting 
    embodies the best of both noble beasts. Elephants taught him compassion; 
    lions taught him to fight without hesitation when innocents are threatened.
    
    He doesn't fully belong to either world. Elephants see him as too 
    fierce; lions see him as too gentle. This isolation made him thoughtful 
    and observant. He learned to appreciate connections with those who 
    accept him as he is.
    
    When Champa first met Kriting, she saw not a monster but a kindred 
    spirit - another creature misunderstood because of appearance. She 
    trumpeted a greeting in elephant-speech, and for the first time in 
    his existence, Kriting felt truly seen.
    
    Now he guards the guardians themselves, using both natures in perfect 
    harmony. In battle, he can shift between elephant patience (defense) 
    and lion aggression (attack) as needed.
