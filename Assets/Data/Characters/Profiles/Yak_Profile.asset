  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: yak_giant
  _displayName: Yak
  _title: The Misunderstood Guardian
  _species: Yaksha (Temple Giant)
  _shortDescription: |
    A massive temple giant who appears terrifying but is actually incredibly 
    gentle. Yak guards temple gates and struggles with how his fearsome 
    appearance scares the children he wants to protect.
  _fullBiography: |
    The Yaksha are temple guardians - massive beings with fearsome faces 
    designed to frighten away evil spirits. Yak was carved from sacred 
    stone and given life by ancient prayers. His face was made terrifying 
    on purpose... but nobody told him he didn't have to FEEL terrifying.
    
    For centuries, Yak stood at temple gates, watching children run 
    screaming from his appearance. He would reach out to comfort them, 
    only for his massive clawed hands to frighten them more. Each tear 
    broke his heart a little more.
    
    He tried to smile. His smile was somehow worse.
    
    Yak became convinced he was a monster. He stopped trying to interact 
    with anyone, standing perfectly still, pretending to be just a statue. 
    Inside, he dreamed of someone looking past his face to see his heart.
    
    That someone was Kavi. The fearless monkey landed on Yak's head, 
    mistaking him for a climbing structure. When Yak moved, Kavi didn't 
    scream - he laughed. "Cool! A living statue!"
    
    For the first time in centuries, someone wasn't afraid. Yak cried 
    tears that could fill rivers. Now he follows the guardians, finally 
    accepted, still learning that he can be more than what he looks like.
