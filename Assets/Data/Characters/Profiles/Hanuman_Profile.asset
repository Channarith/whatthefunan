  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: hanuman_warrior
  _displayName: Hanuman
  _title: The Immortal Champion
  _species: Divine Monkey (Vanara)
  _shortDescription: |
    The legendary warrior-monkey who once helped defeat the demon king. 
    Blessed with immortality, he now mentors a new generation of heroes 
    while searching for a purpose in an age that has forgotten the old ways.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the age of legends, Hanuman was the greatest warrior the world had 
    ever known. Son of the Wind God himself, he possessed strength enough 
    to move mountains, speed to outrace thought, and devotion that could 
    shake the heavens.
    
    He served the divine prince Rama with absolute loyalty, crossing oceans 
    in a single leap, setting demon cities ablaze with his burning tail, and 
    carrying an entire mountain of healing herbs to save a dying friend.
    
    When the war ended, Rama blessed Hanuman with immortality - a gift that 
    has become both blessing and curse. Hanuman has watched civilizations 
    rise and fall, friends age and die, while he remains unchanged.
    
    Now, in the shadow of a new threat, Hanuman has emerged from his 
    mountain meditation. He sees in young Kavi a spirit like his own - wild, 
    brave, and fiercely loyal. Perhaps mentoring this young monkey will 
    give his eternal life new meaning.
