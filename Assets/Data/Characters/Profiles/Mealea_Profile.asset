  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: mealea_apsara
  _displayName: Mealea
  _title: The Celestial Dancer
  _species: Apsara (Celestial Being)
  _shortDescription: |
    A divine dancer from the celestial realm. Her graceful movements can 
    heal allies and mesmerize enemies alike.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the heavenly palace above the clouds, Apsaras dance eternally for the 
    gods. Among them, young Mealea was different. While others danced to please, 
    she danced to feel - every movement expressing an emotion she couldn't name.
    
    The elder Apsaras worried. "You dance with too much... feeling," they said. 
    "You're supposed to be divine and detached." But Mealea couldn't help it. 
    When she saw the mortal world below - the laughter, the tears, the love - 
    she felt something stir in her immortal heart.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent's darkness reached even the heavens, the gods 
    needed a champion. "Send someone who doesn't care about the mortals," 
    advised the council. But the youngest god, impressed by Mealea's 
    compassionate heart, chose her instead.
    
    "You feel too much to be a proper Apsara," he said, "but perhaps that's 
    exactly what makes you perfect for this mission."
    
    Now Mealea walks among mortals for the first time, experiencing everything 
    she'd only watched from above. Every sunset, every friendship, every silly 
    joke from Kavi - it's all miraculous to her. She'll fight to protect this 
    beautiful, chaotic, emotional world.

    - "Kavi making me laugh until my stomach hurt. I didn't know stomachs could do that!"
