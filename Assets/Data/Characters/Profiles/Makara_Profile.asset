  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: makara_dragon
  _displayName: Makara
  _title: The Flame of the Deep
  _species: Makara (Sea Dragon-Crocodile)
  _shortDescription: |
    A mighty sea dragon who breathes underwater fire. Despite his fearsome 
    appearance, he's actually a gentle soul who loves cooking.
  _fullBiography: |
    Makara are legendary creatures - part dragon, part crocodile, part 
    elephant, part fish. They guard the boundaries between worlds. But young 
    Makara was different from his fire-breathing brethren. While others 
    enjoyed destruction, he discovered something wonderful about his flames:
    
    They could cook really, REALLY good food.
    
    "You waste your gift on... CUISINE?!" the elder Makaras roared. But Makara 
    didn't care. He opened an underwater restaurant in an volcanic vent, using 
    his fire breath to create dishes that made even the grumpiest sea monsters 
    smile. His specialty? Perfectly flame-seared fish, medium-rare.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent attacked, Makara tried to reason with it - even 
    offered it a meal. "Darkness cannot taste deliciousness," the serpent 
    hissed. And attacked.
    
    That's when Makara learned his flames could do more than cook. Protecting 
    his restaurant - his dream - awakened the warrior within. Now he fights 
    with the intensity of a thousand suns, not for glory, but so that someday, 
    when peace returns, everyone can share a meal together.
