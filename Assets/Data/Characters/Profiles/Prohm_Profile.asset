  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: prohm_dino
  _displayName: Prohm
  _title: The Last of the Ancients
  _species: Temple Guardian (Stegosaurus-like)
  _shortDescription: |
    An ancient creature who has guarded the temple ruins for millennia. 
    He speaks rarely but sees everything with timeless wisdom.
  _fullBiography: |
    Long before the Funan Kingdom rose, before the first humans walked these 
    lands, there were the Ancients. Massive, gentle creatures who tended the 
    world like a garden. Prohm is the last of them.
    
    He remembers when the mountains were young. He watched the first trees 
    grow. He saw civilizations rise and fall like seasons. Through it all, 
    he guarded his temple - not because anyone asked him to, but because 
    it was home.
    
    Centuries alone changed him. He stopped speaking, then stopped thinking 
    in words altogether. He became like the temple itself - ancient, still, 
    patient. Some thought he was just another statue.
    
    Then the children came.
    
    Village children, playing hide-and-seek in the ruins, discovered Prohm. 
    They weren't afraid. They climbed on him, told him stories, shared their 
    lunches. Slowly, painfully, Prohm remembered what it meant to feel.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent threatened those children, Prohm moved for the 
    first time in centuries. The earth shook. The temple stones sang. And 
    the darkness learned that some things are too ancient to fear.
    
    Now Prohm walks among the new guardians, learning to be alive again. 
    He doesn't talk much. But when he does, everyone listens.
