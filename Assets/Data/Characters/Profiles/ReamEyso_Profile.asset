  _characterId: reameyso_thunder
  _displayName: Ream Eyso
  _title: Lord of Thunder
  _species: Giant (Yeak/Asura)
  _shortDescription: |
    A towering giant who commands thunder with his magical axe. His eternal 
    pursuit of Moni Mekhala creates the storms Cambodia needs. Grumpy on 
    the outside, but secretly enjoys the chase.
  _fullBiography: |
    Ream Eyso was the hermit sage's other student - a giant of immense 
    strength but limited patience. When the sage gave him the thunder axe, 
    Ream Eyso was initially pleased... until he saw Mekhala's crystal ball 
    shine brighter than the sun.
    
    "That should be mine," he growled. "My thunder deserves the best light."
    
    And so began millennia of chasing. Ream Eyso convinced himself he was 
    angry, that he wanted the crystal out of greed. But after thousands of 
    years, even he must admit - if Mekhala ever let him catch her, he 
    wouldn't know what to do.
    
    The chase IS the point. The thunder wouldn't mean anything without 
    lightning to chase. The storms wouldn't bring rain without their 
    dance. Deep down, Ream Eyso knows this. He'd never admit it.
    
    When the Shadow threatened Mekhala, Ream Eyso's rage was genuine - not 
    because someone might take the crystal, but because someone might hurt 
    HER. That realization shook him more than any thunder.
    
    Now they fight alongside each other, and Ream Eyso is learning that 
    partnership might be more satisfying than pursuit... though he still 
    grumbles about wanting that crystal.
