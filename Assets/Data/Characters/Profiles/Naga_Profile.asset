  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: naga_serpent
  _displayName: Naga Prince
  _title: Crown Prince of the Depths
  _species: Seven-Headed Royal Naga
  _shortDescription: |
    The mystical prince of the underwater Naga Kingdom. Each of his seven 
    heads represents a different aspect of water's wisdom.
  _fullBiography: |
    In the sapphire depths beneath Funan lies a kingdom of impossible beauty - 
    the realm of the Nagas. And there, destined to rule, was born a prince 
    with seven magnificent heads, each crowned with a different gemstone.
    
    But the young prince was troubled. Each of his seven heads had its own 
    personality: one was wise, one was playful, one was serious, one was 
    kind, one was fierce, one was curious, and one was always sleepy. 
    Ruling a kingdom when you can't even agree with yourself? Challenging.
    
    His father, the ancient Naga King, sent him to the surface world to 
    learn unity. "Only when all your heads think as one heart can you 
    truly lead," the King said.
    
    On the surface, the Prince discovered something unexpected: friends. 
    Champa taught him about kindness that transcends water and land. Kavi 
    showed him that disagreement can lead to creativity. Slowly, his seven 
    heads began to work together, united by a common purpose.
    
    When the Shadow Serpent attacked, the Naga Prince realized this dark 
    creature was what he could have become - a being of division and hate. 
    He vowed to fight, not just for Funan, but for the unity he'd found.
