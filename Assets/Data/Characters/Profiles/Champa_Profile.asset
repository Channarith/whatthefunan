  # IDENTITY
  _characterId: champa_elephant
  _displayName: Champa
  _title: The Gentle Warrior Princess
  _species: Royal Elephant
  _shortDescription: |
    A noble elephant princess from the royal Funan court. Despite her immense 
    strength, she believes kindness is the mightiest power of all.
  _fullBiography: |
    Princess Champa was born under a double rainbow in the sacred elephant 
    sanctuary of the Funan royal palace. From birth, she was marked by destiny - 
    her trunk bore a golden lotus birthmark, the sign of the chosen guardian.
    
    Though she could crush boulders with her trunk and charge through armies, 
    Champa preferred tending the royal gardens and telling stories to village 
    children. The court elders worried she was too gentle to be a warrior, but 
    her mother, the Queen, knew better.
    
    "True strength," the Queen would say, "is knowing when NOT to use it."
    
    When the Shadow Serpent attacked, Champa proved herself. She stood alone 
    against the darkness, not with violence, but with the light of pure courage. 
    The shadows could not touch her heart. Now she seeks to unite the scattered 
    guardians and restore peace to Funan - with kindness as her greatest weapon.
