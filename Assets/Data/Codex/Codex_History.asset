      title: The Kingdom of Funan
      content: |
        Funan was one of the earliest kingdoms in Southeast Asia, flourishing from 
        the 1st to 6th century CE. Located in the Mekong Delta region, it was a 
        powerful maritime trading empire that connected China with India.
        
        The name "Funan" comes from Chinese records. The local people likely called 
        their kingdom "Bnam" meaning "mountain" - referring to their sacred mountain 
        temples.

      title: Masters of Water
      content: |
        The Funan people were incredible engineers! They built massive canal systems 
        to control flooding and irrigate rice paddies. These canals also served as 
        highways for boats carrying goods.
        
        This knowledge was passed down to later kingdoms like Angkor, which built 
        even larger water management systems.

      title: Faith of Funan
      content: |
        Funan embraced both Hinduism and Buddhism, with temples dedicated to Shiva, 
        Vishnu, and Buddha. The Naga (serpent deity) was especially important as a 
        protector of water and fertility.
        
        Kings often claimed divine ancestry and built mountain temples to connect 
        heaven and earth.
