      title: Naga - The Serpent Deity
      content: |
        Nagas are powerful serpent beings in Southeast Asian mythology. They are 
        protectors of water, guardians of treasure, and bringers of rain.
        
        In Khmer tradition, nagas have 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 heads - with more heads 
        meaning greater power. The Naga King is said to have seven heads!
        
        Many temples feature naga railings along staircases, symbolizing the 
        rainbow bridge between heaven and earth.

    - entryId: codex_singha
      title: Singha - The Guardian Lion
      content: |
        Singha (or Singh) means lion in Sanskrit. These lion guardians protect 
        temples and palaces throughout Southeast Asia.
        
        Interestingly, real lions never lived in this region! The image came from 
        India through trade and religious connections.
        
        Singha statues often guard temple entrances in pairs.

      title: The Mystery of Ta Prohm
      content: |
        At the real Ta Prohm temple in Cambodia, there is a carving that some people 
        think looks like a stegosaurus dinosaur! 
        
        Scientists say it's probably a rhinoceros or boar, but the mystery has 
        captured people's imagination. In our game, Prohm is our friendly 
        stegosaurus-like guardian!
        
        (Real dinosaurs lived millions of years before humans - this is just for fun!)
